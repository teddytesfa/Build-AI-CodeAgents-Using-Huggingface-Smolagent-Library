Building Agents by Leverage Tool Creation Methods Provided by smolagents Library
This notebook demonistate how to build agents that use tools to perform various actions. In smolagents, tools are treated as functions that an LLM can call within an agent system.

In smolagents, tools can be defined in two ways:

Using the @tool decorator for simple function-based tools
Creating a subclass of Tool for more complex functionality

Initialize the InferenceClientModel to use the Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct LLM model via Nebius Inference provider:

model=InferenceClientModel(model_id="Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct", provider="nebius", api_key=userdata.get("HF_NEBIUS_API_KEY"))

The @tool Decorator
Generating a tool that retrieves the highest-rated catering
Let's imagine that Alfred has already decided on the menu for the party, but now he needs help preparing food for such a large number of guests. To do so, he would like to hire a catering service and needs to identify the highest-rated options available. Alfred can leverage a tool to search for the best catering services in his area.

Below is an example of how Alfred can use the @tool decorator to make this happen:


[34]
1s
from smolagents import CodeAgent, InferenceClientModel, tool

# Let's pretend we have a function that fetches the highest-rated catering services.
@tool
def catering_service_tool(query: str) -> str:
    """
    This tool returns the highest-rated catering service in Gotham City.

    Args:
        query: A search term for finding catering services.
    """
    # Example list of catering services and their ratings
    services = {
        "Gotham Catering Co.": 4.9,
        "Wayne Manor Catering": 4.8,
        "Gotham City Events": 4.7,
    }

    # Find the highest rated catering service (simulating search query filtering)
    best_service = max(services, key=services.get)

    return best_service
    


# model = InferenceClientModel(provider="nebius")


agent = CodeAgent(tools=[catering_service_tool], model=model)

# Run the agent to find the best catering service
result = agent.run(
    "Can you give me the name of the highest-rated catering service in Gotham City?"
)

print(result)

Defining a Tool as a Python Class
Generating a tool to generate ideas about the superhero-themed party
Alfred's party at the mansion is a superhero-themed event, but he needs some creative ideas to make it truly special. As a fantastic host, he wants to surprise the guests with a unique theme.

To do this, he can use an agent that generates superhero-themed party ideas based on a given category. This way, Alfred can find the perfect party theme to wow his guests.


[35]
1s
from smolagents import Tool, CodeAgent, InferenceClientModel

class SuperheroPartyThemeTool(Tool):
    name = "superhero_party_theme_generator"
    description = """
    This tool suggests creative superhero-themed party ideas based on a category.
    It returns a unique party theme idea."""

    inputs = {
        "category": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The type of superhero party (e.g., 'classic heroes', 'villain masquerade', 'futuristic Gotham').",
        }
    }

    output_type = "string"

    def forward(self, category: str):
        themes = {
            "classic heroes": "Justice League Gala: Guests come dressed as their favorite DC heroes with themed cocktails like 'The Kryptonite Punch'.",
            "villain masquerade": "Gotham Rogues' Ball: A mysterious masquerade where guests dress as classic Batman villains.",
            "futuristic Gotham": "Neo-Gotham Night: A cyberpunk-style party inspired by Batman Beyond, with neon decorations and futuristic gadgets."
        }

        return themes.get(category.lower(), "Themed party idea not found. Try 'classic heroes', 'villain masquerade', or 'futuristic Gotham'.")

# Instantiate the tool
party_theme_tool = SuperheroPartyThemeTool()
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[party_theme_tool], model=model)

# Run the agent to generate a party theme idea
result = agent.run(
    "What would be a good superhero party idea for a 'villain masquerade' theme?"
)

print(result)

Sharing a Tool to the Hub
Sharing your custom tool with the community is easy! Simply upload it to your Hugging Face account using the push_to_hub() method.

For instance, Alfred can share his catering_service_tool to help others find the best catering services in Gotham. Here's how to do it:


[36]
4s
party_theme_tool.push_to_hub("teddy-tesfa/catering_service_tool", token=userdata.get("HF_TOKEN"))

Importing a Tool from the Hub
You can easily import tools created by other users using the load_tool() function. For example, Alfred might want to generate a promotional image for the party using AI. Instead of building a tool from scratch, he can leverage a predefined one from the community:


[46]
from smolagents import load_tool, CodeAgent, InferenceClientModel
from IPython.display import display
from PIL import Image as PILImage # Import PIL.Image and alias it as PILImage

image_generation_tool = load_tool(
    "m-ric/text-to-image",
    trust_remote_code=True
)

agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[image_generation_tool],
    model=model
)

result = agent.run("Generate an image of a luxurious superhero-themed party at Wayne Manor with made-up superheros.")

# Assuming the agent's run method returns the PIL Image object or a path to it
# If it returns the PIL Image object directly:
if isinstance(result, PILImage.Image):
    display(result)
# If it returns a path to the image:
elif isinstance(result, str) and result.endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif', '.webp')):
     img = PILImage.open(result)
     display(img)

Importing a Hugging Face Space as a Tool
You can also import a HF Space as a tool using Tool.from_space(). This opens up possibilities for integrating with thousands of spaces from the community for tasks from image generation to data analysis.

The tool will connect with the spaces Gradio backend using the gradio_client, so make sure to install it via pip if you don't have it already. For the party, Alfred can also use a HF Space directly for the generation of the previous annoucement AI-generated image. Let's build it!


[47]
!pip install gradio_client

[57]
from smolagents import CodeAgent, InferenceClientModel, Tool
from IPython.display import display
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image as PILImage

image_generation_tool = Tool.from_space(
    "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell",
    name="image_generator",
    description="Generate an image from a prompt"
)

# model = InferenceClientModel("Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct")

agent = CodeAgent(tools=[image_generation_tool], model=model)

result = agent.run(
    "Improve this prompt, then generate an image of it.",
    additional_args={'user_prompt': 'A grand superhero-themed party at Wayne Manor, with Alfred overseeing a luxurious gala'}
)


# Assuming the agent's run method returns the PIL Image object or a path to it
# If it returns the PIL Image object directly:
if isinstance(result, PILImage.Image):
     display(result)
# If it returns a path to the image:
elif isinstance(result, str) and result.endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif', '.webp')):
     img = PILImage.open(result)
     display(img)

[52]

from PIL import Image as PILImage
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

image_path = '/tmp/gradio/20ddbcf66e82363933f32379374327258f42091195fedd29b45596c6d612d114/image.webp'

img = PILImage.open(image_path)
img

Importing a LangChain Tool
These tools need a SerpApi API Key.

You can easily load LangChain tools using the Tool.from_langchain() method. Alfred, ever the perfectionist, is preparing for a spectacular superhero night at Wayne Manor while the Waynes are away. To make sure every detail exceeds expectations, he taps into LangChain tools to find top-tier entertainment ideas.

By using Tool.from_langchain(), Alfred effortlessly adds advanced search functionalities to his smolagent, enabling him to discover exclusive party ideas and services with just a few commands.

Here's how he does it:


[ ]
!pip install langchain-community google-search-results

[ ]
from google.colab import userdata
import os
os.environ["SERPAPI_API_KEY"] = userdata.get('SERPAPI_API_KEY')

[ ]
from langchain.agents import load_tools
from smolagents import CodeAgent, InferenceClientModel, Tool

search_tool = Tool.from_langchain(load_tools(["serpapi"])[0])

agent = CodeAgent(tools=[search_tool], model=model)

agent.run("Search for luxury entertainment ideas for a superhero-themed event, such as live performances and interactive experiences.")

With this setup, Alfred can quickly discover luxurious entertainment options, ensuring Gotham's elite guests have an unforgettable experience. This tool helps him curate the perfect superhero-themed event for Wayne Manor! 🎉
